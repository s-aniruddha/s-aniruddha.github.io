I am Aniruddha Sundararajan, a final year Dual Degree student at [Indian Institute of technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) majoring in Engineering Physics (B.Tech) and Data Science (M.Tech). I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Computer Science, and Physics. My research interests broadly include Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am also intrigued about incorporating symmetries and other first principle abstractions as inductive bias into ML models to both improve their performance and increase their explainability.

Previously, I've worked as a signal processing intern at Texas Instruments, where I performed system modelling and signal level simulation of 10BaseT1S automotive ethernet in MATLAB.


Apart from my coursework at IIT Madras, I constantly
