I am a final year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, where I am majoring in [Engineering Physics](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/program/3) and [Data Science](https://ioe.iitm.ac.in/program/data-science/) (5 year B.Tech + M.Tech. Dual Degree program). I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Computer Science, and Physics. My research interests broadly include Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am also intrigued about incorporating symmetries and other first principle abstractions as inductive bias into ML models to both improve their performance and increase their explainability.

Previously, I have worked as a signal processing intern at Texas Instruments, where I performed system modelling and signal level simulation of 10BaseT1S automotive ethernet in MATLAB. I have also worked as an Applied Scientist intern at Amazon in the Finance Automation team, where I worked in both supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection.

In my junior year, I was awarded the prestigious [IITM Young Research Fellowship](https://yrf.iitm.ac.in/) to work on a year-long funded research project. Through the program, I worked with [Prof. Avhishek Chatterjee](https://sites.google.com/site/avhishek1984/) from the EE department of IIT Madras on the project "Achieving near capacity performance on queue-channel systems with waiting-time dependent errors". For my thesis project, I am working with [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) from the CS department of IIT Madras on the project "Matching options to tasks using Option Indexed Heirarchical Reinforcement Learning".


Apart from doing the coursework at IIT Madras, I regularly learn various topics via MOOCs and constantly seek to improve myself.

## Projects

* **Optimization:** I made an academic poster as part of a group project in the course EE5121 Convex Optimization. It encapsulates key results from the paper [How Does Batch Normalization Help Optimization?](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/hash/905056c1ac1dad141560467e0a99e1cf-Abstract.html) by Shibani Santurkar, Dimitris Tsipras, Andrew Ilyas, and Aleksander Madry. Check it out [here.](https://github.com/s-aniruddha/EE5121-Optimization-Project)

* **Achieving near-capacity performance in queue-channel systems with waiting-time dependent errors:** As part of the IITM Young Research Fellow Program, I designed error control coding schemes that achieve high data rates and make bits/qubits robust to noise in queue-channel systems with waiting time dependent errors by adapting the convolutional encoder and the BCJR decoder to suit this channel. [Here's](https://github.com/s-aniruddha/Young-Research-Fellow) an academic poster I made to summarize my work.

* **Linear Algebra:** I reproduced the numerical results of the paper [Estimation of the bilinear form y\*f(A)x for Hermitian matrices](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002437951500511X)
by P. Fika and M. Mitrouli. The key idea is to estimate bilinear forms of f(A) without explicitly calculating f(A) by extrapolating the moments y\*f(A)x. Check out the detailed report [here](https://github.com/s-aniruddha/EE5120-Linear-Algebra-Project).

* **Nand2Tetris:** I completed the *Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part I and Part II * from Coursera. In the first 6 projects, I built the hardware part of a fully functioning general-purpose modern computer starting from logic gates. In the next 6 projects, I built a modern software hierarchy that can translate and execute object-based, high-level languages on a bare-bone computer hardware platform. I also implemented a virtual machine and a compiler for a Java-like programming language (Jack). In project 9, I built a rudimentary runner game (similar to Google's Trex run) in the Jack language. You can find my code for all assignments in my github page [here](https://github.com/s-aniruddha/nand2tetris).

* **Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms Using Python:** I made a series of [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/s-aniruddha/Programming-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Using-Python-NPTEL) while I was doing the NPTEL course to aid my learning. They may be useful for anyone who is looking to get started with coding in python and learn basic data structures and algorithms.
