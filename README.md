I am a final year Dual Degree student at Indian Institute of technology, Madras, where I am majoring in [Engineering Physics](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/program/3) and [Data Science](https://ioe.iitm.ac.in/program/data-science/). I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Computer Science, and Physics. My research interests broadly include Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am also intrigued about incorporating symmetries and other first principle abstractions as inductive bias into ML models to both improve their performance and increase their explainability.

Previously, I've worked as a signal processing intern at Texas Instruments, where I performed system modelling and signal level simulation of 10BaseT1S automotive ethernet in MATLAB. In my junior year, I was awarded the Young Research Fellow to work on a year-long funded research project. 


Apart from my coursework at IIT Madras, I constantly
